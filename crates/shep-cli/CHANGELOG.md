### Added

- Dogs.toml gets a type and a path
- ShepToml can take the dog sections out
- Dog config moves to dogs.toml, migrated on boot

### Fixed

- Take_dog_sections keeps nested tables, arrays and inline tables

## [0.1.31] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Shep add, which registers a sheep and starts nothing

### Fixed

- The skew guard already gates add, and say so accurately


## [0.1.30] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- The override store, locked and owner-only like the KV store
- Shep start <file> applies a template additively; shep start <name> reads nothing
- --reset and --reset-all on a Flockfile load
- A CFG column and a describe section, so pending config is visible
- A Flockfile is a template, and a load applies it without killing anything ([#104](https://github.com/shep-pm/shep/pull/104))

### Fixed

- Validate shep.toml before a daemon reload, not after the predecessor is gone
- Make the reload pre-flight file-only, not env-layered
- Move the env-layer pin from an unfalsifiable unit test to a real e2e case
- A Flockfile load that refused an app exits non-zero
- Keep the overridden cache correct across reload, scale-up and restore
- The pending clause is a gerund, so it agrees with one field or many
- A reset resolves an undeclared key to the file, not to the default
- A Flockfile that names a dog is refused, not merged onto it
- A fresh start establishes the keys its Flockfile declared
- A reset flag on a bare script target is refused, not ignored
- Describe prints a clustered app's config sections once


## [0.1.29] - 2026-09-03


## [0.1.28] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Stamp every log line with the time it was written
- Make `silent` lead somewhere

### Fixed

- Keep a log line meaning one thing on both of its paths
- Flush a narration line, or it can be lost outright
- Stop prescribing a reinstall for every dog shep gave up on
- Give `counting_lines` back the cfg its neighbour took
- Stop the given-up note naming a cause it cannot know


### Added

- `silent` leads somewhere. `shep flock` prints one line under the dogs table
  naming every silent dog, and `shep describe <dog>` carries the long form:
  whether the shepherd is still waiting on that dog or has given up on it,
  and which command answers the rest. The give-up had no surface at all
  before — an operator could watch a dog read `silent` forever with nothing
  telling them shep had stopped trying. Neither addition touches a column:
  the pointer is prose under the finished table. `--format json` carries
  `dog_stale` on every dog row.

### Fixed

- `shep daemon reload`'s report about dogs that could not come back no longer
  prescribes a reinstall. It is handed names and nothing else, and that
  population includes dogs a reinstall cannot fix — one of them cost an
  operator two days. It now says the shepherd gave up and sends the reader to
  `shep bleats <dog>`, which is where the shepherd wrote what it actually
  saw. The daemon's version is still named, as the thing a rebuild would
  target rather than as an instruction to rebuild.

- `shep bleats --no-follow` and `shep lookout`'s tail pane strip the daemon's
  new per-line timestamp before rendering, so a line means the same thing
  there as it does on the bus. Without this, `--follow` and `--no-follow`
  would report a sheep as having said two different things, and
  `--format json`'s `line` would have carried a prefix the sheep never wrote.

## [0.1.27] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Refuse `shep enable` of a name that is neither built-in nor adopted

## [0.1.25] - 2026-09-01

### Added

### Fixed

- Let [[dog.bark.rules]] actually parse from TOML


## [0.1.18] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Daemon reload takes the handover arm

### Fixed

- The handover drops an in-flight request, by design
- A successor skips the roll whatever size its flock is
- Reload drops its probe connection before the stop arm
- Running_version is read only on unix, so bind it only there
- Prove the successor is serving before reporting through it
- Make the descriptor-restore case able to fail
- Outlive the predecessor before trusting a successor
- Refuse the handover arm when no witness can be held


## [0.1.17] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- The handshake refusal names the daemon's version
- Refuse a shepherd whose version differs, and name the fix
- Guard the three verbs that connect on their own
- Shep daemon reload, the verb the skew refusal names
- Make shep daemon reload discoverable from --help

### Fixed

- Shep kill can stop a daemon that refuses the handshake
- A refusal is not an absence
- Sanitise the daemon's version before printing the refusal


## [0.1.16] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Stop counting a sheep's threads as processes on Linux


## [0.1.15] - 2026-08-29


## [0.1.14] - 2026-08-29


## [0.1.13] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

## [0.1.12] - 2026-08-29


## [0.1.11] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Unify dog-action and reply-row Render impls in rows.rs
- Expand the shared JSON-key rule as a macro, for 1.93's sake

### Performance

- Hand paint the rows it consumes, and demote the last rustdoc rationale


## [0.1.10] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- `shep start <selector>` acted on every sheep sharing a name instead of the
  rows the selector named. It resolved the selector against the listing, then
  collapsed the matched rows to their distinct NAMES before putting them on
  the wire, and a name selector reaches every instance that name has. Two ways
  that bit an operator running a clustered app: `shep start 0` against ten
  stopped instances started all ten, and `shep start all` with one instance
  online and nine stopped restarted the online one too, walking back over the
  row `resume_all` had deliberately set aside. Respawns now go out one per
  row, by id. Found on a ten-instance app.
- A sheep that could not spawn no longer abandons the rows after it. `start`
  returned on the first failure, so an app in a fold that could not start left
  every app behind it in that fold down and unmentioned. It now attempts every
  row and returns the first failing code, which is the rule the other
  selector-taking verbs already state and follow.
- The already-running notice quotes the target the operator typed. `shep start
  0` against one live instance of a ten-instance app used to answer "zam is
  already online; `shep restart zam` replaces it", suggesting a command that
  acts on all ten. A path or Flockfile target still falls back to names, since
  `shep restart ./rotom.sh` is not a command.
- A failed `shep start` prints no flock table. Its output guards keyed on
  whether any row had come up rather than on the outcome, which agreed with
  itself only while a failure stopped the run. Once every row is attempted, a
  fold whose second app fails and whose third succeeds ends both non-empty and
  failed, and under `--format json` that put a data envelope beside an error
  envelope: two answers to one question.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-28


## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-28


### Additions

- The dogs table's columns line up with the sheep table's. Every column the
  two share sits in the same order and each table's own columns come last, so
  the dogs table gains `ID` and `EXIT` and moves `SOURCE` from second to last.
  Both fields were already on the `ProcessInfo` it builds from, so this is no
  wire change. `FOLD` and `SMIT` stay off it because they are impossible for a
  dog rather than empty.

- `SOURCE` carries the one trust distinction shep draws. `adopted` is a
  third-party binary running at the shepherd's own trust level from an
  operator-supplied path; `built-in` is shep running its own code. They no
  longer look identical.

- Colour reaches every table that has something to say with one, which is
  fifteen of the twenty-two in `output::rows`. The eight newly covered are the
  three per-sheep reply tables (`trigger`, `signal`, `whisper`), `flush`'s
  two, `startup`'s, `barks` and `kill`, plus `import`'s `REUSE_PORT`. Seven
  stay plain on purpose, each with the reason recorded on its impl.

- Colour reaches the seven `Render` impls that are not the flock table.
  `colour_cell` had only ever appeared inside `FlockRows`, so one of eight
  tables was coloured and the same dog read one way under `shep dogs` and
  another under `shep flock`. The dogs table and the `enable`/`disable`/
  `adopt`/`rehome` confirmations now take the flock table's own rules, and
  `shep empty`'s table mutes its id and its placeholders. `describe`'s lamb
  table stays plain: two identity columns with no state, no reading and no
  placeholder, so there is nothing for a colour to carry.

- `shep start` takes the selector grammar every other lifecycle verb takes:
  `all`, `fold:<name>`, `/regex/`, globs, and a bare id. `shep stop
  fold:backed` worked and `shep start fold:backed` refused with "backed is not
  `-`, a recognised Flockfile, or an existing path", because `start` alone
  took a different argument grammar. Folds were actionable everywhere except
  the verb that creates things.

- A bare token is also tried as a fold name, so `shep start backed` reaches
  the fold `backed`. The full order, first tier that matches wins: a sheep by
  id or name, then a fold, then a Flockfile, then a path on disk. Written down
  in `shep start --help` and on the folds page, since a precedence rule is
  only reasonable if the person it surprises can find out why.

- `./backed` always means the file. A sheep name may never contain a path
  separator, so a target carrying one skips the flock entirely. That is what
  gives somebody whose fold shares a name with a file a way to say which they
  meant.

### Fixes

- A `.js` Flockfile that keeps node alive is killed rather than left to hang
  `shep start`. A config module that leaves a server listening or a timer
  armed can assign `module.exports` and return while node's event loop stays
  alive, so node never exits and shep held the terminal for as long as the
  operator left it open: there was no bound on the wait, and Ctrl-C was the
  only way out, which is no answer at all for a CI job or a provisioning
  script running `shep start` with nobody watching. node gets 30 seconds now,
  then shep kills it and refuses with `InvalidConfig`, naming the file and the
  likely cause. The near neighbour gets its own sentence rather than the same
  one: a module that exits cleanly but leaves a process of its own holding
  node's stdout or stderr is refused for that, since nothing was killed
  there.

- Cell colour is keyed on a column's NAME rather than its index. The old
  `rows_for` painted `row[0]`, `row[4]`, `row[9]` and `row[10]`, which are
  facts about one table's column order: reordering columns repointed every one
  of them with nothing failing to compile and no test able to notice.

- Say so when a Flockfile app names a sheep the flock already has under a
  different config, instead of ignoring the edit in silence. `shep start` on
  a registered name adds instances rather than reconciling config, so
  changing an app's `cwd` and re-running `shep start` left it running the old
  one with nothing printed; the apps then crash-looped against a path that no
  longer applied and only a `shep delete` plus a fresh start recovered them.
  `start` now asks the daemon (`Request::ConfigDrift`) before resuming
  anything and names the sheep and every field that differs, on stderr, so
  `--format json` piping is unaffected. Reported, never applied: whether
  `start` should reconcile by default or grow an `--update` flag is a
  separate decision, and changing a running flock's `cwd` or argv underneath
  an operator would be a worse surprise than the bug being fixed. Field names
  only, never values, since `env` carries secrets.

- A selector that matched nothing is reported as a selector. `shep start
  fold:typo` said `fold:typo is not ... an existing path` and sent an operator
  looking for a file they had never asked about; it now says no sheep is in a
  fold called typo, and exits 3 like every other verb does.

- Every lifecycle verb prints the whole flock afterwards, not only the rows it
  touched. `shep start koji` printed a one-row table containing koji; the
  question an operator has after a lifecycle command is what the flock looks
  like now, which a one-row table cannot answer and which the exit code
  already covered for the sheep they named. Applies to `start`, `stop`,
  `restart`, `reload`, `delete` and `stock`. `describe` stays narrow, because
  answering about one sheep is what it is for.

- A lifecycle verb acting on a dog renders it through the dogs table rather
  than the sheep table. `shep restart log-rotate` gave it an id, a face, and a
  `FOLD` and `SMIT` a dog can never fill, while dropping the `SOURCE` column
  that says whether it was adopted or is built in. Falls out of the change
  above: the listing goes through the same renderer `shep flock` uses.

- `--format json` is deliberately NOT widened by either of those. A script
  running `shep stop web --format json` asked about `web`, so `data` still
  holds `web`'s rows; widening it would break every consumer reading
  `data[0]`. `shep flock --format json` is the way to ask for the flock.

- `shep lookout`'s flock table draws by name, then by id, rather than by id.
  It repolls every two seconds, so the tiebreak is what stops two instances of
  one app swapping places under the cursor between refreshes.

- `shep bleats` tails a flock's log files in name order, and `shep flock`
  against a stopped shepherd lists the saved roll in name order. Both used
  the order they happened to be handed.

- Table columns are padded by the columns a name draws in, not by its
  character count. A CJK or emoji glyph counts as one character and draws as
  two, so a name built from them hung over its own column and pushed every
  column after it out of line. In `shep lookout` such a name could also lose
  the `…` that says it was cut. The box-drawn table, the plain one and
  `lookout` now measure the same way.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-26

### Additions

- Add `shep <name> [args...]`, which runs an adopted dog directly and passes
  every remaining argument straight through, the precedent git's `git foo`
  (running `git-foo`) and cargo's `cargo foo` (running `cargo-foo`) already
  set. The lookup reads only `[daemon] adopted_dogs` in `shep.toml`, never a
  `$PATH` scan: `shep adopt` already vetted the binary once, at adopt time, and
  a `$PATH` scan here would let any stray binary on the machine answer to a
  shep verb. A built-in verb always wins, since the dispatch only runs once
  clap has already failed to match the token against a real subcommand or
  alias, and `shep adopt` itself now refuses to register a name that collides
  with one. A name matching neither a verb nor an adopted dog is still the
  ordinary unrecognized subcommand error, suggestion included. `$SHEP_HOME`
  reaches the dog's environment the same way it does for one the shepherd
  starts; everything typed after the name is the dog's own argv, which is the
  reason to invoke it this way instead of through `shep enable`.

### Fixes

- `shep adopt` resolves a bare binary name against `$PATH` and a leading `~/`
  against `$HOME` before refusing it as missing. `cargo install
  shep-log-rotate` puts the binary on `$PATH`, and neither `shep adopt
  shep-log-rotate` nor `shep adopt '~/.cargo/bin/shep-log-rotate'` worked
  before this fix: only a plain absolute or CWD-relative path did. A bare name
  is looked up only when it has no directory component, and only against an
  entry with its execute bit set, so a same-named non-executable file earlier
  on `$PATH` cannot shadow the real binary. A path that resolves through
  neither still reaches the same missing-binary refusal it always has; nothing
  about what `adopt` vets once a path is resolved has changed.
- `shep adopt` checks a name collision with a built-in verb before it vets the
  candidate binary, not after. `shep adopt ./mydog --name stop` used to run
  `./mydog` to prove the kernel could exec it, and only then refuse the name: a
  refusal that has already run the thing it refuses is not a refusal. The
  candidate is never executed now when its name collides with an existing verb
  or alias.
- An unrecognized command that names no adopted dog no longer creates
  `$SHEP_HOME`. Looking one up went through the same path a config edit does,
  which unconditionally creates the runtime directory and writes an empty
  `shep.toml` even though the lookup only reads. On a fresh machine, a typo
  like `shep flcok` therefore left `$SHEP_HOME` and a `shep.toml` behind as a
  side effect of a lookup that found nothing. A missing `$SHEP_HOME`, or a
  `shep.toml` that has never heard of the name, is now an ordinary no-such-dog
  answer, and the filesystem is left exactly as the lookup found it.
- `shep dogs --available` accepts a dog index whose `"version"` field is
  written `1.0` rather than the bare integer `1`. JSON draws no line between
  the two, but the parser checked only the integer reading, so a hand-written
  or differently serialized index spelling the version with a decimal point was
  refused with a message telling the operator to upgrade shep, which was false:
  no newer shep would have read it either. Both readings are checked now, and
  the index parses.

### Changes

- `shep adopt` takes one positional argument, the path, with the dog's name
  given by an optional `--name` flag; it no longer takes `<name> <path>` as two
  required positionals. This breaks any existing script or muscle memory typing
  the old two-positional form, deliberately: there is no way to parse both
  shapes unambiguously, so a silent compatibility shim would sometimes read the
  arguments backwards, which is worse than a change that fails loudly. Sheep
  already work this way (`shep start <script>` with an optional `--name`), and
  adopt now matches. Omitting `--name` defaults the dog's name to the binary's
  file stem with one leading `shep-` stripped, matching how cargo names its own
  external subcommands: `shep-log-rotate` defaults to `log-rotate`, and a
  binary with no `shep-` prefix keeps its whole stem. `shep enable --exec
  <path> <name>`, pm2's own hidden spelling, is unchanged.
- `web/public/dogs.json`, the community dog index `shep dogs --available`
  reads, is now an object carrying `$schema`, `version` and a `dogs` array,
  rather than a bare top-level array of entries. A shep 0.1.0 binary pointed at
  the live index, or a self-hosted one, now gets a refusal instead of an empty
  or wrong listing: the parser requires the new shape and names the old one
  explicitly in its error. The entries inside `dogs` are unchanged: same
  fields, same validation, same sanitizing. The `version` field is
  load-bearing, not decoration; a version this build does not recognize is its
  own named refusal with a message pointing at an upgrade, so the next
  incompatible reshape of the wrapper can announce itself the same way instead
  of repeating this break silently.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-26

### Additions

- `shep flock` and `shep describe` gain an `EXIT` column: the exit code, or
  the signal name (`SIGTERM`, not `15`), for a sheep that is not running, and
  `-` otherwise. A boot-looping sheep previously reported only `errored` and a
  restart count, which cannot distinguish an app crashing on its own from one
  that never spawned. `--format json` carries the same under `last_exit`.
- `shep bleats` prints the tail of each log before it starts following, and
  `--lines N` says how much (default 15, counted per stream; `0` follows
  without replaying). Following alone showed an empty screen for a sheep that
  had already died, leaving its reason in a file the operator had no reason to
  look in.

- Add `--flockfile` to `shep start`. With it, `shep start <path> --flockfile`
  reads `<path>` as a Flockfile by extension — including `.js`, evaluated by
  shelling out to
  `node -e "try { process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(require(process.argv[1]))); } catch (err) { process.stderr.write(err && err.message ? String(err.message) : String(err)); process.exitCode = 1; }" <path>`
  and feeding the JSON result through the existing parser — instead of
  treating it as a script. Not `node -p` bare: node's own crash dump on an
  uncaught exception ends with a trailing `Node.js vX.Y.Z` banner line, so
  scraping the last non-blank line of stderr would quote the banner instead
  of the actual error; the try/catch writes `err.message` to stderr itself
  instead. `shep start server.js` with no flag is unchanged: it still starts
  `server.js`. The flag is on `start` only, not `restart`, `reload`, or
  `import`.
- Add the hidden `shep schema` verb — prints the Flockfile JSON Schema to
  stdout. The same rendering is committed at
  `crates/shep-core/assets/flockfile.schema.json`, drift-guarded by an
  `include_str!` test in shep-core; regenerate with `cargo run -p shep --
  schema > crates/shep-core/assets/flockfile.schema.json`.
- Add `--log-json[=BOOL]`, `--log-level <LEVEL>`, `--socket <PATH>` and
  `--max-cron-sleep <DUR>` to the hidden `shep daemon` verb — a third
  `file < env < flags` layer over `shep.toml` and the `SHEP_*` variables,
  validated once after all three are merged so a flag can rescue a broken
  file.
- Add `--init <systemd|openrc|launchd|freebsd-rc|openbsd-rc>` to
  `shep startup` and `shep unstartup`, overriding the runtime probe below on
  any target.
- Add openrc, FreeBSD `rc.d`, and OpenBSD `rc.d` renderers to `shep startup` /
  `shep unstartup`, alongside the existing systemd and launchd renderers.
  None of the three has been executed on its own operating system — no
  FreeBSD, OpenBSD, or openrc host exists here. They are pure `format!`
  output pinned by exact-string tests, the same tier the systemd unit has
  always had. openrc's script polls the shepherd's own control socket in
  `start_post()` to decide when the service is up, because openrc has no
  `sd_notify` equivalent; FreeBSD gets the same poll through
  `start_postcmd`; OpenBSD's `rc.subr` has no post-start hook at all, so its
  script reports started as soon as the process is spawned and says so in
  its own header comment.
- Add `shep lookout` (alias `dash`), the terminal dashboard: the flock table,
  the bleats feed, the sheep detail pane, and a host-usage strip, all on one
  screen. The flock table stays the spine and subscribes to the bus so the
  screen moves as things happen, then re-lists the flock every two seconds so
  a dropped event cannot leave it quietly wrong. Selecting a row grows the
  detail pane and the bleats feed, which re-reads the selected sheep's log
  files on every refresh, and adds its lambs, fetched once on selection
  rather than on every listing; a host-usage strip sits above. A narrow or
  short terminal drops panes before it drops columns. If the shepherd stops
  answering it re-dials five times over about eight seconds, then says so and
  freezes: the last known values stay on screen and it does not exit. `/`
  opens a name filter that narrows the table as you type, without losing
  track of the flock's true size. The action gate (`--allow-control` or
  `shep set lookout.allow_control true`) is closed by default; open, three
  keys arm a confirm on the selected sheep, `x` for stop, `R` for restart,
  `L` for reload, and Enter sends it while any other key cancels. There is
  no `start` key: lookout only ever acts on a sheep already in the flock,
  and the gate is a fat-finger catch, not a security boundary, since lookout
  runs as your own process under your own uid.
- Add `shep stock <name> <count>` (alias `scale`) — "stocking rate" is the
  husbandry term for how many animals a piece of land runs.
- Add `shep signal <selector> <signal>`.
- Add `shep whisper <selector> <line>` (alias `sendline`), for apps whose
  Flockfile sets `stdin = true`. Completes the pair `bleats` already
  started: bleats is what the sheep says to you, whisper is what you say
  to the sheep.
- Add `shep set` / `shep get` / `shep unset` (spec §5's KV store). They read
  and write `$SHEP_HOME/kv.json` directly and never connect to the shepherd.
- `shep describe` renders each sheep's lambs beneath its row, captioned with
  what the parent-pid walk is and what it is not. A sheep with no lambs
  prints exactly what it printed before.
- Add the hidden `shep dog <name>` subcommand — the re-exec target a
  built-in dog runs as, the same shape `shep daemon` already is: not for
  direct use, spawned by the shepherd when it starts an enabled dog.

  A dog inherits exactly one thing from the shepherd's own environment,
  `$SHEP_HOME`, and nothing else it did not already need in order to exec
  — no `[dog.<name>]` value ever rides along, since the environment is
  readable from the process table, inherited by every child a dog spawns,
  and captured into crash dumps. Instead `DogRuntime::start` connects to
  the socket `$SHEP_HOME` names and asks for its own section over the
  wire, and `DogRuntime::config` parses it into whatever shape the dog
  expects — refusing to run on a section it cannot read rather than
  silently falling back to defaults an operator did not ask for.

  `shep dog <name>` refuses an unrecognised name before ever touching the
  socket (`usage`, naming the two built-ins): `"metrics"` runs the metrics
  dog below, `"bark"` the bark dog further down this file. A dog's own
  diagnostics go to stderr, plain text: it is a supervised process, and the
  shepherd's log pump already captures that into
  `$SHEP_HOME/logs/<name>-0-err.log` like any sheep's — `shep bleats <name>`
  is how an operator reads it.

- Add `shep enable <name>` and `shep disable <name>`, the operator verbs
  that turn a registered dog on and off. Both write `$SHEP_HOME/shep.toml`
  first and only then, if a shepherd is reachable, ask it to act — so a
  failed or skipped RPC still leaves the config saying what the operator
  asked for, and the next boot honours it.

  - `enable` adds `name` to `[daemon] enabled_dogs` (idempotently) and
    ensures a `[dog.<name>]` table exists to configure it through, then
    sends `EnableDog` if a shepherd answers. Against a name a sheep
    already holds, the daemon refuses with `invalid_config` and a message
    naming the collision; that message reaches the operator verbatim.
  - `disable` removes `name` from `enabled_dogs`, leaving `[dog.<name>]`
    in place — a disabled dog's own configuration survives, unlike
    `shep rehome` (a later verb), which forgets it entirely — then sends
    `DisableDog` if a shepherd answers.
  - Neither verb autostarts a shepherd (`shep muster` is the one verb that
    does). Against no running daemon, both still exit `0`: the config edit
    is the part the operator asked for, and it landed. A `--format json`
    reply's `shepherd_acted` field says whether a shepherd was actually
    reached; `status` is the resulting state either way.
  - A config change reaches an already-running dog only through
    `disable` then `enable` again — neither verb re-reads a running dog's
    `[dog.<name>]` section on its own.

  `shep.toml` is edited through `toml_edit`, not round-tripped through a
  plain `toml::Table`: an operator's comments, key order, and formatting
  survive a `shep enable`/`shep disable`, since that file is hand-written
  far more often than it is generated. A `shep.toml` that fails to parse
  is refused rather than overwritten.

- Add `shep adopt <name> <path>` and `shep rehome <name>`, the verbs that
  register and forget a third-party dog. **An adopted dog runs at the
  shepherd's own trust level, with no sandboxing beyond it** — `adopt`
  vets the binary before running it, not against it being hostile.

  - `adopt` refuses, before `shep.toml` is touched at all, a path that:
    - doesn't exist,
    - exists but isn't a file (most often a `bin/` directory the operator
      meant to point inside of),
    - exists but has no execute bit set for anyone,
    - can be written by any user on this system — the binary itself or the
      directory holding it, since a writable directory lets the binary be
      renamed away and a replacement dropped in its place, or
    - is executable and this kernel still refuses to run it — the wrong
      architecture, or a shebang naming an absent interpreter.

    The writability check reads the canonicalized path, the one actually
    recorded, and runs BEFORE the exec probe below, which runs the binary:
    a binary any user can rewrite is not one to run in order to find out
    whether it runs. A GROUP-writable file or directory is warned about
    instead of refused, naming the path — a deploy directory owned by a
    trusted group is an ordinary arrangement, and refusing it outright
    would break real setups. That split is the one OpenSSH makes for
    `authorized_keys` and sudo for `sudoers`: refuse the unambiguous case,
    don't be clever about the ambiguous one.

    The last check is answered by actually running the binary (with no
    arguments, exactly as the daemon later will) and killing it the moment
    it's confirmed to run — never by reading its header, which would mean
    trusting a second, partial loader that can disagree with the real one.
  - A vetted path is recorded ABSOLUTE and canonicalized in
    `[daemon] adopted_dogs`, so a reboot's boot path (which spawns from
    whatever working directory the init system handed it) resolves the
    same binary the operator pointed at, not whatever a relative path
    happens to mean from wherever the daemon starts.
  - `rehome` is to `adopt` what `disable` is to `enable`, with one more
    thing forgotten: it removes `name` from `enabled_dogs` AND
    `adopted_dogs`, and drops its `[dog.<name>]` table entirely — where
    `disable` deliberately keeps that table so a dog's own configuration
    survives being turned off and back on.
  - Neither verb autostarts a shepherd, matching `enable`/`disable`: both
    write the config and exit `0` even with no shepherd running, and a
    shepherd is still asked to act (start or stop the dog) whenever one
    answers.
  - `shep enable --exec <path> <name>` is kept as a hidden alias for
    `adopt`, pm2's own spelling, for muscle memory — note the argument
    order: pm2's own spelling puts the path first, `shep adopt` puts the
    name first. It doesn't appear in `--help`; `shep adopt` is the verb
    that does.

- `shep flock` prints a second table beneath the flock's own whenever any
  dog is registered, captioned `Dogs` — headers `NAME`, `SOURCE`, `STATUS`,
  `PID`, `RESTARTS`, `CPU`, `MEM`, `UPTIME`. No `ID` column: ids reflect
  spawn order across the one registry the sheep and dogs share, and the two
  populations are never rendered together, so that shared id space costs
  nothing at the surface. `SOURCE` renders `built-in` or `adopted`; an
  adopted binary's own path stays JSON-only, the same reason `flock`'s own
  table already keeps `out_file`/`err_file` off it.

  `shep dogs` lists the dogs and nothing else, through that same table
  renderer. Neither verb gained a flag to opt in or out — a flock listing
  always shows every sheep and every dog.

  `--format json` is unchanged in shape: one `data` array, every entry,
  each still carrying its own `dog` marker. The table split is a rendering
  decision only.

- Add the clap command tree (`Cli`, `Commands`, and every argument struct
  the CLI will ever parse — `Start`, `Stop`/`Restart`/`Reload`/`Delete`/
  `Describe`, `Trigger`, `Flock` (aliases `list`/`ls`), `Fold`, `Bleats`
  (alias `logs`), `Reopen`, `Flush`, `Ping`, `Kill`, `Completions`, the
  hidden `Thatlldo` and `Daemon`), pure tier so it compiles and its tests
  run on Windows.
- Add `shep reload <selector>`: replace each instance of the matched sheep
  with a fresh one, one instance at a time, so the app gets a window in which
  it can hand over. **Not zero downtime** — the old listener's queue of
  connections it has not accepted yet is dropped when it closes, so an app
  that does not stop accepting and finish what it has in hand before
  `graceful_timeout` runs out loses whatever was waiting there. The verb's
  own `--help` says so.

  **A port-binding app has to set `SO_REUSEPORT` itself before it binds**, or
  every reload of it fails. shep binds nothing and so cannot set the option
  on the app's behalf; the `reuse_port` app option is the operator asserting
  that the app does, and a mismatch is `EADDRINUSE` at the replacement spawn,
  undetectable in advance. What the operator sees without it is nothing at
  all: `shep reload` has already exited 0 by the time the replacement fails,
  so the abandonment shows up as `process.reload_abandoned` on the bus and in
  the shepherd's log, and the old instance goes on serving. `--help` names
  the precondition for the same reason.

  The selector is **required**, exactly as it is for `stop`/`restart`/
  `delete` and for the same reason: the verb replaces running processes, so
  the operator names the target. That requirement is now pinned by a test
  covering every verb sharing `SelectorArgs` — a `default_value` on that one
  field would have turned a bare `shep stop` into `shep stop all` for six
  verbs at once, and nothing caught it before.

  **The command exits as soon as the shepherd accepts the reload**, printing
  the flock as it stood at that moment rather than after the swaps. A
  clustered app takes longer to swap than any reply can wait for, so the
  alternative was not a slower `shep reload` but one that reported a timeout
  for a reload still running. Progress is on the bus, under `process.reload`,
  `process.reloaded` and `process.reload_abandoned`.
- Add the process exit-code taxonomy (`ExitCode`, matching spec §9's table
  exactly, values included) with its stable `code_str` spelling and a
  `From<RpcErrorCode>` conversion; the three `From<&shep_client::*Error>`
  conversions are unix-only, since the error types they read from are.
- Add `main`'s dispatch skeleton: argument parsing, `$SHEP_HOME` resolution
  from `--home`/`$SHEP_HOME`/`$HOME`, and a placeholder arm for every verb —
  each replaced by its own command module as that verb is implemented.
- Exit code 2 (`Usage`) is clap's own convention for bad arguments and
  collides with the fail-fast code spec §9 reserves for the `runtime`
  subcommand's own use. `runtime` does not exist yet; whichever change
  builds it resolves the collision deliberately, rather than discovering it.
- Carry `ProcessInfo`'s new `out_file`/`err_file` in every `--json` payload
  built from `FlockRows` (`flock`, `describe`, `fold`, `start`, `stop`,
  `restart`, `reload`, `reopen`). They are `JSON_ONLY` on those verbs, not
  columns:
  absolute log paths are routinely longer than the rest of the row put
  together and would wreck the table they exist to print. `flush` is the one
  exception and renders them — see its own entry below.
- Add the end-to-end test tier (`tests/cli_e2e.rs`): the real `shep` binary
  against a real daemon, a real socket, and real spawned sheep, each on a
  fresh `$SHEP_HOME`. Five groups of cases. **Daemon lifecycle**:
  autostart from cold, daemon reuse across commands, the concurrent
  cold-start race, `kill`'s socket teardown, and that an autostarted daemon
  binds under the `--home` it was given rather than an ambient `$SHEP_HOME`.
  **Output contract**: exit codes and stdout/stderr stream discipline under
  `--format json`, and the committed fixtures below. **The log plane**:
  `bleats --no-follow` against real log files (both default and `--out`),
  `reopen` after an external rename, an external `copytruncate` with no shep
  verb involved at all, `flush` and its refusal to run without a selector, and
  the two `[daemon]` log knobs deciding the renderer and the level of the
  daemon's own records. **Restart triggers on their real clocks**: a write
  under a watched tree and a dot-file write that must trigger nothing, a cron
  occurrence, and a memory ceiling a process tree really crosses — the last
  two on wall time, not a paused one, which is what makes them the slowest
  cases in the workspace and the reason they are not `#[ignore]`d (an ignored
  test closes no gap). **Config-time refusals and the readiness gate**: a bad
  cron pattern and an `https://` probe target, each failing at parse rather
  than three seconds into a sheep's life, and a `wait_ready` sheep that holds
  at `starting` until it signals. Unix-only (`#![cfg(unix)]`): an
  integration test file is its own compilation unit, so without the gate
  `--all-targets` would build it — with its unix-only `nix` dev-dependency —
  on the Windows CI leg too.
- Commit `--format json` fixtures for `flock`, `describe`, `start`, `ping`
  and `bleats --no-follow` under `tests/fixtures/*.json` (IR-35's byte-fixture
  discipline, same as the wire protocol). The four envelopes are compared
  structurally, with the fields a real spawned process cannot pin across
  runs (`pid`, `uptime_ms`, `out_file`, `err_file`) asserted against their
  own real shape and then normalized before the comparison; `bleats
  --no-follow`'s one JSON-line-per-record output carries no envelope (see
  its own entry below) and is compared byte-for-byte.
- `DaemonAlreadyRunning = 10` is a cross-crate contract, not an internal
  implementation detail: `shep-client`'s `spawn::DAEMON_ALREADY_RUNNING`
  hard-codes the same number so `connect_or_spawn` can tell "a losing
  cold-start racer's daemon exited on purpose" apart from every other exit,
  which is what lets both sides of a concurrent `shep start` race exit 0
  (`cli_e2e`'s `concurrent_cold_starts_produce_exactly_one_daemon` proves
  this against two real, genuinely concurrent invocations). Changing either
  side without the other
  reintroduces the race — `exit.rs`'s own test pins the two constants equal.
- Render the daemon's own diagnostics. The hidden `daemon` subcommand now
  installs a `tracing-subscriber` on **stderr**, which `launch.rs` already
  redirects into `$SHEP_HOME/logs/shepd.err.log` — so a hand-run daemon logs
  to the terminal it was run from, and a launched one logs to that file,
  without either path naming a file here. `[daemon] log_level`
  (`SHEP_LOG_LEVEL`) picks the level, default `warn`; the long-parsed
  `[daemon] log_json` (`SHEP_LOG_JSON`) finally does something and switches
  the renderer to JSON lines. Colour is on only when stderr is a terminal and
  `NO_COLOR` is unset or empty — that one is a cross-ecosystem convention
  about the terminal rather than a shep knob, which is why it is honoured
  where `RUST_LOG` is deliberately ignored.
  Every `tracing` record in `shep-daemon` reached nobody before this: a watch
  that could not be armed, a cron pattern that would not parse, and the
  observed RSS and ceiling behind a memory restart — the last of which no
  bus event carries at all. `shep-daemon`'s own changelog carries the count;
  repeating it here is what let it go stale.
- Add `shep reopen [selector]`, which tells the daemon to reopen the log
  files of the sheep the selector matches — the half of `create`-mode
  rotation that runs after the rotator's rename. A zero exit means every
  matched sheep's log pump holds a handle on the recreated path, so a
  logrotate `postrotate` stanza can wait for it. A rotator that moved the log
  DIRECTORY aside rather than the files is covered too: the pump puts it back
  at `0700`, the mode every directory shep creates gets. The selector is
  optional and defaults to `all`, matching `bleats` rather than
  `stop`/`restart`/`delete`: those destroy something and this destroys
  nothing, and rotating the whole flock at once is the ordinary case. A
  matched sheep that is not running has nothing to reopen and is listed in
  the output rather than failing the command. A pump that could not open a
  path again does fail it, naming the sheep and the path: the rename is
  still safe to act on, but that sheep is writing a stream nowhere, and
  exiting 0 there would be the silent failure this verb exists to end. **That
  failure can name a sheep the selector did not** — the daemon asks every
  writer to a path it is rotating, which during a reload is both halves of a
  swap, while the table stays keyed by the selector. The
  request carries `LOG_PLANE_DEADLINE` rather than the client's 5s default,
  since the daemon visits matched sheep serially with no per-sheep bound —
  the default would report failure to a `postrotate` stanza whose reopen was
  still running. Output is the same table of matched sheep `stop` and
  `restart` print. A rotator that would rather signal a pid than run a client
  can send the daemon `SIGUSR2` instead, which does the same work at the
  `all` selector — see `shep-daemon`'s entry for what that form gives up: no
  reply to wait on, and no narrower selector.
- Add `shep flush <selector>`, which empties the log files of the sheep the
  selector matches: the daemon flushes what every pump writing to one of
  those files still owes it, then truncates the paths those sheep were
  registered with. **The selector is required**, where `bleats` and `reopen`
  both default to `all` — this is the one command in the CLI whose slip of
  the finger cannot be undone, so it follows `stop`/`restart`/`delete` and
  makes the operator name a target. `shep flush all` is still short to type
  when it is meant. What it empties is exactly the paths the Flockfile
  named: `out_file`/`err_file` are taken verbatim and never checked against
  the log directory, so an app pointing one of them at a file that is not a
  log has that file emptied too, with the shepherd's privileges. A matched
  sheep that is not running is emptied like any other, since the operation
  addresses paths rather than open handles and a stopped sheep's logs are
  still readable with `shep bleats --no-follow`. The sheep goes on
  logging into the same file afterwards, at offset 0 — its handle is
  `O_APPEND` and the daemon never touches it. A file that could not be
  emptied fails the command and is named on stderr; exiting 0 there would
  leave an operator believing a log is empty when it holds everything it did
  before. No selector reaches the shepherd's own
  `shepd.out.log`/`shepd.err.log`: the CLI's launcher creates those before the
  daemon exists and the daemon inherits them as plain fds 1 and 2, so it holds
  no handle to flush and no path to truncate — they are `--daemon`'s, below.
  Output is one row per matched SHEEP, not per file emptied, carrying that
  sheep's two log paths: `ID`, `NAME`, `OUT_FILE`, `ERR_FILE`. `flush` is the
  only flock-shaped verb that renders the paths rather than keeping them to
  `--format json`, and it is the only one whose subject is the files — a verb
  that empties something an operator may have mistyped and then reports
  `STATUS`/`PID`/`UPTIME` has said nothing about what it destroyed. The
  lifecycle fields stay in the JSON, which is byte-identical to what the other
  verbs answer with, so nothing consuming `--format json` has to special-case
  this command. A sheep sharing a log path with a matched one has that file
  emptied under it as well, its pump flushed first like any other writer to
  that path, and no row of its own: the selector names sheep, and so does the
  table.
- Add `shep flush --daemon`, the only way to empty the shepherd's own
  `shepd.out.log`/`shepd.err.log`. It **replaces** the selector rather than
  composing with it — `shep flush all --daemon` is a usage error — because the
  two halves answer with different shapes, because one invocation renders one
  payload, and because the shepherd's logs are meant to be reached only by
  being named rather than by riding along with a flock-wide flush. A flag and
  not a reserved `shep` selector: nothing stops an app being named `shep`, and
  a selector that meant something different depending on the Flockfile would
  be a trap. The CLI empties these two itself and asks the daemon nothing —
  they are the CLI's files, and it needs no socket, so this is the one flush
  that works while the shepherd is down, which is when an operator most often
  wants it. No flush barrier is needed or possible: the daemon's records go
  through its subscriber straight to fd 2, synchronously, with nothing queued
  to outrun a truncate. Output is a table of the files themselves — stream,
  path, and whether each was `emptied` or `absent` — because for this half the
  paths ARE the answer. A file that is not there is already empty and is
  reported rather than created, so `shep flush --daemon` on a cold
  `$SHEP_HOME` exits 0.
- Add `shep trigger <selector> <action> [params]`, which sends a named,
  free-form action to the sheep the selector matches over its shepherd
  channel and reports what each one answered. Delivery needs `channel = true`
  in the app's own Flockfile — or `wait_ready`/`shutdown_with_message`,
  either of which opens the same channel on its own — and nothing user-facing
  said so before this: an operator without it got a `no_channel` row and no
  way to know why. Both `--help` and the row itself now name the field. The
  selector is **required**, matching `stop`/`restart`/`reload`/`delete`/
  `describe`: this reaches a running app, so the operator names the target.

  A row's own outcome is never a request failure — `replied`, `no_channel`,
  `skipped` (a reload drainee, mid-swap) and `timed_out` (no reply inside the
  app's own `action_timeout`) all render as rows of one successful reply, the
  same precedent `reopen`/`flush` set for a per-sheep refusal inside a
  request that otherwise succeeded. Only a selector matching nothing, or the
  daemon itself being unreachable, fails the command as a whole.

  The table renders `ID`/`NAME`/`OUTCOME`/`DETAIL`; a `Replied` body is
  arbitrary, app-chosen text of unknown length, so the table cannot show it
  verbatim the way `--format json` does — a long body would stretch every row
  in the column to match it, and an embedded newline would split one row
  across output lines and desync every column beneath it. `DETAIL` therefore
  escapes embedded newlines to `\n`/`\r` and caps the preview at 80
  characters with a trailing `...`; `--format json` always carries the real
  reply, full length, real newlines included. Sent with a 60s deadline
  (`TRIGGER_DEADLINE`, `shep-client`) rather than the client's 5s default,
  since an app's own `action_timeout` can be configured up to 58s and the
  default would abandon a reply the daemon was still honestly building.

  `parse_selector` — duplicated once per verb module (`lifecycle`, `logs`,
  `query`, `bleats`) and about to become a fifth copy for this verb — is now
  one function in `commands::selector`, landed as its own commit ahead of
  this one so the new verb builds on a single copy instead of adding to the
  pile.

- Add `shep save`, which asks the daemon to write the muster roll now,
  bypassing the snapshot writer's debounce (`Request::SaveRoll` /
  `Response::RollSaved`). `save` is pm2's own word, so the muscle memory
  transfers directly. It takes **no selector**: the roll always records the
  whole flock, so it is not one of the six verbs `SelectorArgs` gates.

  The reply names the path the daemon wrote and how many apps that roll
  records, and both ride the table — `FILE`/`APPS`, every field a column,
  matching `EmptiedFiles`' own reason: a verb that wrote a file and would not
  say which one has reported nothing. A failed save exits non-zero and names
  why, rather than the silent no-op the verb exists to rule out.

  Dispatched through `connect_client`, never `connect_or_spawn_client`:
  saving the roll of a daemon that is not running is not a thing, and
  autostarting one just to save an empty flock would overwrite a good roll
  with an empty one.

- Add `shep muster` (hidden alias `resurrect`, pm2's own word), which asks
  the daemon to assemble the flock from the roll `save` wrote
  (`Request::Muster` / `Response::Mustered`), rendered the same way `flock`
  is. Sent with `START_DEADLINE` rather than the client's 5s default, same
  reasoning as `start`: a muster spawns every app in the roll, and a cold
  restore of a real flock routinely outruns five seconds. An empty
  `Mustered` — the roll restored nothing — gets an explicit notice on
  stderr, so that answer is never a silent exit 0.

  This is the binary's **second** autostart path, after `start`: dispatched
  through `connect_or_spawn_client` rather than `connect_client`, because
  bringing a fresh daemon up is the whole point of the verb on a machine
  that just rebooted. When that autostart itself just spawned the daemon,
  boot has already restored the roll before this request goes out, so the
  `Muster` that follows spawns nothing new and simply reports the flock
  restore produced — `Response::Mustered` always names every sheep of every
  app the roll restored, not only what this particular call spawned, which
  is what makes the verb idempotent for an init system that runs it more
  than once.

- Add `shep import`, which reads a pm2 dump (`--from`, default
  `~/.pm2/dump.pm2`) and writes it out as a Flockfile (`--out`, default
  `./Flockfile.toml`) — the last piece of the pm2 cutover path.
  **Starts nothing**: no client, no daemon round trip, just a file
  read and a file write. `--dry-run` prints the rendered Flockfile to
  stdout instead of writing it, with no envelope, so
  `shep import --dry-run > Flockfile.toml` produces a byte-exact file;
  without it, an existing output path is left alone unless `--force`.

  A pm2 dump is per-instance — one row per running process — so the
  conversion collapses same-named rows back into one app each, taking the
  first row's scalars (script, cwd, interpreter, ...) and the row count as
  `instances`. **Every clustered app is named on stderr**: shep binds
  nothing, so N instances on one port is `EADDRINUSE` at start unless the
  app itself sets `SO_REUSEPORT` (Node's `reusePort: true`, needing Node
  >= 22.12) — the warning exists so that is discovered at import time, not
  at the first restart. **Every ambiguous env key is named on stderr and
  left out of the Flockfile**: a key that is neither declared in an
  ecosystem file's `env_<name>` block nor recognizable login-shell or pm2
  session junk is the operator's to decide, never guessed at — an
  inherited `BUN_INSTALL` or `DATABASE_URL` is exactly the kind of thing a
  heuristic would eventually get wrong, silently. `NODE_APP_INSTANCE`
  becomes `increment_var` rather than a copied value, since copying it
  would pin instance 0's number into every instance.

  The renderer serializes a purpose-built projection of `AppConfig`, not
  the type itself — `AppConfig` is `#[serde(default)]` across roughly forty
  fields and would bury the handful that matter under the rest, each
  written out at its own spec default. Every field this importer can
  produce is skipped when it already matches that default, and
  `max_memory`/`restart_delay` render in their string forms (`"512M"`,
  `"5s"`), never as raw integers a Flockfile parser would reject.

- Add `shep daemon --foreground`, for an init system that runs the shepherd
  itself rather than letting the CLI autostart one. It reports readiness on
  `$NOTIFY_SOCKET` once the muster restore has finished, which is what lets a
  `Type=notify` unit go green when the flock is actually back instead of when
  the process execs.

  It is a second arrangement, not a second code path. `shep daemon` already
  runs the supervisor in this process; the flag adds the readiness report and
  nothing else — no fork, no re-exec, not one step of the boot changed.
  Everything that makes an autostarted daemon survivable on its own — the new
  process group, the detached terminal, stderr redirected into
  `shepd.err.log` — lives in `launch.rs`, on the *parent's* side of a re-exec
  this arrangement never performs, and systemd does those jobs itself.

  The flag is also the only thing that turns the report on, so a `shep` the
  CLI autostarts from inside some other notify-type service inherits that
  service's `$NOTIFY_SOCKET` and stays silent on it. `launch_daemon` passes
  exactly one argument, `daemon`, and its own test pins that argument vector.

- Add `shep startup` and `shep unstartup`, which install and remove the init
  unit that brings the shepherd — and the flock it last saved — back after a
  reboot. On Linux that is a systemd unit at
  `/etc/systemd/system/shep-<user>.service`, `Type=notify` so the unit goes
  green once the restore has finished rather than when the process execs; on
  macOS a `LaunchDaemon` plist at
  `/Library/LaunchDaemons/io.github.turtiesocks.shep.<user>.plist`. Both
  carry this binary's resolved path, the target user's `$SHEP_HOME`, and the
  `PATH` of the invocation that wrote them — the last of those is what makes
  an interpreter installed under `~/.bun` or `~/.cargo` findable on a machine
  that has only just booted.

  **shep never escalates.** No `sudo`, no setuid, no privilege helper
  anywhere on this path. Running as root it writes the unit and enables it;
  running as anyone else it prints the exact command to run — fully resolved,
  and quoted, so a `$SHEP_HOME` with a space in it survives the paste — and
  exits non-zero, so a script notices instead of believing a unit was
  installed. `unstartup` disables and removes under the same rule, and prints
  its own command without a `--home`, since a removal is addressed by the
  unit's path and label alone.

  **Under `sudo` the unit is built for `$SUDO_USER`, never for root.** The
  invoking user IS root there, so a unit resolved from it would supervise
  root's flock while the operator's stayed down, and would look correct doing
  it. The `$SHEP_HOME` follows the same rule and comes from the target user's
  passwd entry rather than `$HOME`, which `sudo` has already reset to root's:
  a unit carrying `/root/.shep` boots cleanly and restores nothing, and says
  so months later or not at all. A `$SHEP_HOME` that does not exist is
  refused rather than written into a unit, because that is what the same trap
  produces when nobody catches it.

  **`shep startup` warns when `PATH` may have been sanitized.** `sudo` on
  most distributions replaces `PATH` with its own `secure_path` before the
  command runs, so a unit written by `sudo shep startup` can end up
  carrying that rather than the operator's login `PATH` — invisibly, since
  the substitution happens before shep is even exec'd and there is nothing
  left in the environment afterward to tell the two apart. What shep *can*
  see is `$SUDO_USER`, which `sudo` sets on the same command line: when it
  is present, `startup` prints a notice naming it and showing the exact
  `PATH` about to go into the unit, so the operator can check it against
  their own login `PATH` at install time rather than at the next reboot.
  It is a warning, not a refusal — a sanitized `PATH` is often exactly what
  the operator wants, and shep has no way to tell the two cases apart.
  `systemctl cat shep-<user>` shows what was actually written, at install
  time or any time after; `sudo --preserve-env=PATH shep startup ...`
  (after `shep unstartup`, since an existing unit is never overwritten)
  carries the login `PATH` through instead.

  **An existing unit is never overwritten.** `shep startup` refuses and names
  `shep unstartup`. Rewriting the file changes nothing about the service
  already loaded on either init system, so an overwrite would leave the file
  and the running unit disagreeing — and an operator who edited theirs in
  place should be told, not have the edits replaced. `unstartup` then
  `startup` closes both halves; a `--force` flag would close neither.

  Output is one row per step, in the order the steps were taken: the file
  written or removed, and each `systemctl`/`launchctl` invocation, with what
  it answered. A step that fails does not stop the ones after it — a
  half-installed unit is worse than a fully-attempted one, and the operator
  needs every row to know which half they are holding — and the command exits
  non-zero once they have all run. `shep unstartup` on a machine that never
  ran `startup` reports the unit `absent` and exits 0, matching
  `shep flush --daemon` on a log file that is not there.

  openrc and the BSD rc.d scripts get no renderer: spec §11 names four init
  systems and this pair covers two, chosen by compile target rather than by
  probing which init system is actually running. A target that is neither
  Linux nor macOS is refused before any file is written, with a
  platform-level message; a Linux host running openrc still gets a systemd
  unit, and the mismatch surfaces later, at the `systemctl` step.

- `flock` and `describe` show each sheep's live CPU and memory. `CPU` and
  `MEM` land between `RESTARTS` and `UPTIME`, where `pm2 ls` puts them and
  where an operator scanning the table looks; `-` for a sheep with no
  reading, the same rule `PID` and `FOLD` already follow and for the same
  reason — an empty cell in a padded table reads as a bug, and `0.0%` would
  claim something the daemon never measured.

  `MEM` goes through a new `human_bytes`, not `MemSize`'s own `Display`:
  that impl only names a unit that divides the value exactly, so a live
  resident set of 50 462 720 bytes would print as the unreadable "50462720"
  rather than "48.1M". `CPU` gets the same one decimal place — six would be
  noise on a number this volatile.

  Both fields already rode along in the JSON; this only gives them a
  column. `shep flush`'s own table is untouched — its CHANGELOG entry
  already covers why lifecycle and resource fields stay JSON-only there.

- Add `dog::metrics::exposition::render`, which turns a flock snapshot into
  Prometheus text exposition (format version 0.0.4), and `shep dog metrics`
  (below), the dog that serves it. No `prometheus` crate: the format is one
  line per series over data that already arrives as a plain
  `Vec<ProcessInfo>` per scrape, never accumulated, so a
  registry/collector/gatherer stack would buy nothing this function
  doesn't already do directly.

  | Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `shep_sheep_cpu_percent` | gauge | `sheep`, `id`, `fold` | tree CPU, omitted when the daemon has no sample |
  | `shep_sheep_memory_bytes` | gauge | `sheep`, `id`, `fold` | tree RSS, omitted when the daemon has no sample |
  | `shep_sheep_restart_total` | counter | `sheep`, `id`, `fold` | restarts since registration |
  | `shep_sheep_uptime_seconds` | gauge | `sheep`, `id`, `fold` | seconds since last successful start |
  | `shep_sheep_status` | gauge | `sheep`, `id`, `fold`, `status` | one series per lifecycle state, `1` for the current one |
  | `shep_dog_up` | gauge | `dog`, `source` | `1` when the dog is online, `0` otherwise |
  | `shep_daemon_up` | gauge | `version` | always `1` — the scrape reached the shepherd |
  | `shep_daemon_pid` | gauge | — | the shepherd's own pid |
  | `shep_host_memory_total_bytes` | gauge | — | total physical memory on the host |
  | `shep_host_memory_used_bytes` | gauge | — | memory in use on the host |
  | `shep_host_processes` | gauge | — | processes running on the host, the flock included |
  | `shep_host_uptime_seconds` | gauge | — | seconds since the host booted |

  A sheep with no CPU/memory sample contributes no series for those two
  metrics rather than a `0` — a zero is a claim the daemon declined to
  make, and a dashboard averaging invented zeros would report a flock
  idler than it actually is. `shep_sheep_status` is one series per state
  with a `status` label, not a single gauge holding an enum ordinal, so an
  alert can name `status="errored"` without the enum's declaration order
  in front of it. `shep_dog_up` covers every *registered* dog, including
  one that never spawned or exhausted its restart budget — both report
  `0` rather than going missing, because "is the monitoring itself up" is
  the one question monitoring cannot answer with a missing series. The
  `shep_host_*` group is omitted entirely when the host sample is
  unavailable. Label values are escaped per the exposition format
  (backslash, double quote, newline) — a sheep's name is operator-supplied
  and reaches the renderer verbatim.

- `shep dog metrics` (spawned by the shepherd when `metrics` is enabled)
  serves the exposition above over plain HTTP. `[dog.metrics] bind`
  chooses the listen address, defaulting to `127.0.0.1:9615` —
  loopback, and only loopback, unless the operator names a wider one
  explicitly: a metrics endpoint carries every sheep's name, and on many
  hosts a sheep's name is the name of an internal service, so this dog
  never widens its own exposure as a side effect of `shep enable`. An
  unrecognised key under `[dog.metrics]` is a startup error naming it,
  not a dog silently serving on a port the operator didn't choose.

  `/metrics` answers the exposition; every other path answers `404`
  naming `/metrics`, so a scrape config that happens to work against `/`
  doesn't quietly break the day that path is honoured. Each scrape is a
  live `ListFlock` against the shepherd — never a cached reading
  refreshed on a timer — so a scrape faster than the shepherd's own
  sampling window sees the same number twice, honestly: that's the
  resolution the underlying sample has. A shepherd that doesn't answer
  gets a `503`, not a stale exposition or an empty `200` a scraper would
  read as "the flock is empty." A bind failure (`EADDRINUSE`, most often
  a second shepherd or the operator's own Prometheus pushgateway) is a
  fatal, named exit, not a warning — this dog's whole purpose is that
  port. `shep disable metrics` stops it on `SIGTERM`, the shepherd's own
  first rung of its kill ladder, rather than riding it all the way to
  `SIGKILL`.

- `dog::bark::sinks`: `Sink`, the three webhook destinations one fired bark
  can be delivered to — `discord` (`{"content": "..."}`), `slack`
  (`{"text": "..."}`), and `json` (an operator-templated POST, defaulting
  to an object carrying `subject`, `rule`, `message` and `at_ms`). A
  templated `body` substitutes `{subject}`, `{rule}`, `{message}` and
  `{at_ms}` — the three strings JSON-escaped, `at_ms` a bare number — and
  `render_body` refuses to send a template that does not render valid
  JSON, naming the parser's own complaint rather than letting an operator
  guess at the 400 every one of these endpoints answers a malformed body
  with.

  `deliver` POSTs the rendered body over a hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 client,
  bounded end-to-end (connect, handshake, write, read) by one timeout. A
  non-2xx reply is `SinkError::Status`, carrying the code and the first
  line of the body — Discord's own rate-limit `429` arrives this way and
  reads as one, rather than as a silently-swallowed success.

  Two new workspace dependencies: `tokio-rustls` and `webpki-roots`, named
  directly rather than pulling in `reqwest`. Discord and Slack webhooks
  are HTTPS-only, so this phase needs a TLS client somewhere, and the maintainer's
  ruling (2026-08-12) was a hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 request/response over
  `tokio-rustls`'s connector — the same call already made for the metrics
  dog's HTTP *server* side, aimed the other way — rather than `reqwest`.
  Measured against this workspace's existing dependency tree: `reqwest`'s
  default `rustls` feature costs +93 crates and a C build dependency
  (`aws-lc-sys`, `cmake`); `tokio-rustls` + `webpki-roots`, named with
  `ring` as the crypto provider instead of the default `aws_lc_rs`, cost
  11 unique runtime crates (plus 3 build-time-only crates behind `ring`'s
  own build script) and no C toolchain — the extra one over the ruling's
  own "+10" estimate is `webpki-roots` 0.26's own semver-trick shim onto
  `webpki-roots` 1.x, confirmed with `cargo tree -p shep-cli`. What
  `reqwest` adds beyond that includes QUIC/HTTP3, wasm/JNI bindings, ICU
  (IDNA), and a `tower` stack — none of it reachable from a Unix daemon
  POSTing to a webhook. A sink's
  `url` is a bearer credential (Discord and Slack embed the token in the
  path), so `Sink`'s `Debug` is hand-written and redacted rather than
  derived; `SinkError` carries the sink's kind and failure kind, never its
  URL.

- `dog::bark::rules`: `Rules`, deciding which events become a bark and
  which are filtered out. Four trigger kinds under `[dog.bark.rules]`'s
  `on = "..."` key: `event` (any of a configured list of bus event kinds,
  by wire spelling — `exit`, `errored`, `online`, ...), `gave_up` (a sheep
  reached `Errored` — on by default with no configuration at all, since
  it is the alert that must not be missed), `restart_rate` (`restarts`
  restarts within `within` — opt-in, since it is the one that pages at
  3am for a blip and the threshold should be one the operator chose), and
  `memory_above` (a sheep's memory crossed a `bytes` ceiling). A
  `[dog.bark]` with sinks configured and no `[[dog.bark.rules]]` at all
  still alerts: `Rules::default_rules` builds one `gave_up` rule routed to
  every configured sink.

  Two routes feed the same rule set: `on_event` off the daemon bus, and
  `on_poll` off a reconciliation snapshot of the flock. Both exist because
  `tokio::sync::broadcast` drops events for a lagging subscriber rather
  than queueing them — the daemon surfaces that as `BusEvent::Dropped` —
  so a dog that only listened to the bus would miss some. `restart_rate`
  and `memory_above` are two rules, not one, because a restart is
  something that HAPPENS (a bus edge bark can count occurrences of) and
  memory is a LEVEL (only ever known by reading the current sample), and
  `restart_rate` itself only ever evaluates off `on_poll`, reading the
  shepherd's own `ProcessInfo::restarts` rather than tallying `restart`
  bus events itself — a private tally drifts from the number the
  shepherd acts on, and would tell the operator a different story from
  the one the supervisor believes.

  Debounce (`[dog.bark.rules]`'s own `debounce`, five minutes by default)
  is per rule PER SUBJECT, never global: a global debounce would mean the
  second sheep to go down during an incident is silent, and that is the
  incident's most interesting fact. The same per-rule-per-subject state
  is what lets one `Errored` seen by both routes — off the bus, and off
  the very next poll — fire once rather than twice: whichever route sees
  it first records the firing, and the debounce covers the other.
  `Rules::new` refuses a configuration that cannot work before it ever
  runs: a rule routing to a sink `[dog.bark.sinks]` does not define, a
  rule routing to no sink at all, or an `event` rule naming a kind that
  is not on the wire are all startup errors, not alerts that fire
  correctly for months and deliver nowhere.

- The bark dog itself now runs: `[dog.bark]` (`BarkConfig` — named sinks,
  named rules, a reconciliation `poll` interval, a `barks.jsonl` byte cap,
  and a per-delivery `sink_timeout`), and `run_loop`, the engine that
  subscribes to the shepherd's bus AND polls the flock. `shep dog bark`
  no longer stubs out — `run_dog`'s `"bark"` arm parses the section,
  builds `Rules` (the default `gave_up` rule when the operator configured
  none), subscribes on `process.*`, and drives the loop until `SIGINT`,
  `SIGTERM`, or the subscription itself ends.

  **A dropped frame polls immediately**, rather than waiting for the next
  scheduled poll. `tokio::sync::broadcast` drops what a lagging
  subscriber cannot keep up with instead of queueing it, and the load
  that produces a drop is exactly the load that produces an alert — a
  dog that only reconciled on a timer would stay silent for the whole
  poll interval, and under a paused clock, forever. The subscription is
  what makes bark fast; the poll is what makes it correct.

  Every firing is delivered by a task spawned off the select loop, never
  awaited inline: a slow sink (Discord's own rate limit is measured in
  seconds) must not stop this loop from reading the next bus event, or it
  causes the exact drop it exists to catch. The record is written to
  `barks.jsonl` AFTER delivery, with each sink's outcome filled in
  honestly — including when every sink refuses it, since the local trail
  is what an operator reads when the page never arrived. `barks::append`
  is a read-modify-rename against one file; this dog's own concurrent
  delivery tasks serialize their appends behind an in-process
  `tokio::sync::Mutex` held only around the `append` call itself, on top
  of (never in place of) `barks::append`'s own cross-process `flock(2)`
  lock, which is what keeps this dog and the shepherd's own writer from
  losing each other's records.

  `BarkConfig` needed a hand-written `Default`: `#[serde(default)]`
  requires one, and a derived impl would give `poll = 0` (a hot polling
  loop), `history_bytes = 0` (the ring evicted back to empty on every
  append) and `sink_timeout = 0` (every delivery timed out before it
  could leave the process). The defaults are 30s, `shep_core::barks::DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES`,
  and 10s respectively — an empty `[dog.bark]` is the ordinary case, and
  it needed sane numbers, not zeros.

- Add `shep barks [--tail N]`, which shows the alert history —
  `barks.jsonl` — newest last, the same order a reader scrolling to the
  bottom of a terminal expects and the same one `tail` itself gives.
  `--tail N` shows only the last N.

  Reads the file directly and **never connects to the shepherd**: the
  history is on disk precisely so it survives the shepherd, and the case
  it exists for is an operator reading it after a crash — the same
  precedent `shep flush --daemon` set for a verb that answers from a file
  rather than the socket. A line a writer died mid-append costs the
  reader that one record, never the whole read (`shep_core::barks::read`'s
  own contract); `shep barks` adds no tolerance of its own on top of it,
  because none is missing.

  Columns: `WHEN`, `RULE`, `SUBJECT`, `MESSAGE`, `SINKS`. `WHEN` renders
  the millis as a local timestamp — the machine surface keeps the raw
  `at_ms`. `SINKS` renders a delivered sink by its bare name and a refused
  one with `(failed)` appended, so the failure is visible in the table an
  operator is already reading rather than only in `--format json`; a bark
  the shepherd wrote itself, with no sinks at all, renders `-`.
- Add `shep whistle`, the ninth verb: serves the Model Context Protocol on
  stdin/stdout for an AI agent host. Five read-only tools — `list_flock`,
  `describe_sheep`, `get_metrics`, `tail_bleats`, `list_barks` — are always
  offered; the four that act — `start_sheep`, `stop_sheep`, `restart_sheep`,
  `reload_sheep` — exist only when `[whistle] allow_control = true` in
  `$SHEP_HOME/shep.toml`. That gate is a fat-finger catch, not a security
  boundary — whistle runs as the operator's own uid, so anything it could do
  the operator could already do with `shep stop` — and it is deliberately a
  config-file key rather than a flag or environment variable, for the
  legibility a diffable file gives an auditor. Writes nothing to stdout but
  the JSON-RPC wire; a `shep.toml` that fails to parse reads as the gate
  shut, never open, and prints the parse failure to stderr.
- **`shep-cli` is now a library crate with three thin `[[bin]]` targets over
  it** (`shep`, `shep-runtime`, `shep-dev`), rather than one bare binary.
  Every module stays private; the crate's whole public API is three
  functions — `main`, `main_runtime`, `main_dev` — each returning
  `std::process::ExitCode`. This is a packaging change only: it exists
  because the two container-entrypoint aliases spec §3 asks for cannot share
  a module tree between `[[bin]]` targets without a library crate
  underneath, and it is deliberately not a second embedding API — that is
  `shep-client`'s job. `cargo test -p shep --lib --bins --all-features`
  is the scoped test run from here on; `--bins` alone now runs almost
  nothing.
- Add `shep serve <dir>`, a static file server run as a managed sheep by
  default (`--foreground` runs it in the current terminal instead).
  Hand-rolled, not built on axum or tower-http. `--spa` serves `index.html`
  for a missing path when the request accepts HTML; `--auth <creds-file>`
  requires HTTP basic auth against a `user:password` line, checked in
  constant time, from a file that must be mode 0600. Three exposure knobs
  are off by default and each is a deliberate divergence from pm2's own
  `serve`: `--listing` (a directory with no `index.html` 404s rather than
  listing its contents), `--hidden` (a path with a dotfile component 404s,
  so `shep serve .` in a repo checkout does not publish `.env` or `.git`),
  and `--follow-symlinks` (every symlink under the docroot 404s, not only
  one that leaves it — refused by a component-by-component walk, with a
  stderr line naming the refused path and the flag, on top of an
  `O_NOFOLLOW` leaf open that closes the remaining race for the default
  case). `--bind` widens the loopback default; every response carries
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
- Add `shep runtime`, the foreground no-daemon mode for containers: resolves
  a Flockfile, boots the flock in-process with no daemon socket, and
  auto-exits once the flock is empty of online processes — exit 0 if every
  sheep stopped clean, exit 11 (`flock_empty`, a new exit code) if one ended
  in `errored`. At PID 1 it splits into a separate init process first, which
  relies on the kernel already treating real PID 1 as the implicit subreaper
  (no `set_child_subreaper` call needed there), forwards
  SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP/SIGQUIT to the supervisor it spawns, and reaps every
  orphan with its own `WNOHANG` loop — kept out of the supervisor's own
  process so it cannot race tokio's child reaping. `$SHEP_FORCE_INIT`, a
  test-only override, drives the same split and signal forwarding off PID 1
  but gets no orphan reaping, since the kernel then reparents orphans
  elsewhere. `shep-runtime` is the `[[bin]]` alias that supplies the
  `runtime` verb for a container `ENTRYPOINT`.
- Add `shep dev`, an isolated foreground development flock: forced watch,
  auto-exit, and `$SHEP_DEV_HOME` (default `~/.shep-dev`, overridable for
  tests) instead of the operator's real `$SHEP_HOME`, so a `shep dev` run
  never touches a production flock's state. `shep-dev` is the `[[bin]]`
  alias that supplies the `dev` verb.

### Fixes

- `shep bleats --no-follow` is no longer fixed at 50 lines. It shares the new
  `--lines` default of 15 and is controllable for the first time.

- A read-only verb run where no shepherd has ever started now says so, instead
  of forwarding the raw `connect(2)` failure. `shep flock` on a fresh machine
  used to print ``could not connect to `/root/.shep/run/shep.sock`: No such
  file or directory (os error 2)``, which is accurate and reads like a broken
  install, about a path the operator did not choose. It now prints `no shepherd
  is running (no socket at <path>); start one with `shep start <target>``.
  Only the absent-socket case changes: a permission failure or a refused
  connection keeps the OS detail, because those mean something specific and a
  refusal in particular is a stale socket file rather than a missing shepherd,
  which `shep start` would not fix. `shep-client`'s own wording is unchanged,
  since it is published for embedders and a library should not tell its caller
  to run a shell command.

- `shep enable <name>` sends the source `shep.toml` actually records, not a
  hardcoded `built-in`. A name in `[daemon] adopted_dogs` is an adopted dog
  and the path recorded there is its binary; a name absent from that map is
  a built-in one — the same rule the daemon's own boot path already applies
  to `enabled_dogs`. `enable` claimed `built-in` for every name, so
  `shep adopt otel /opt/otel-dog` followed by `shep enable otel` had the
  shepherd spawn `shep dog otel`, an argv branch of the shep binary,
  instead of the operator's binary: the adopted dog never ran, and nothing
  reported an error anywhere. `shep adopt` itself was unaffected — it
  carries the path it just vetted — so the gap was only in enabling an
  adopted dog afterwards, which is exactly what a reboot-time `enable` or
  a `disable` then `enable` does.

  `enable` and `disable` report the source they found, so an adopted dog
  now renders `adopted` in their `SOURCE` column and carries its path in
  `--format json`, where both used to print `built-in` for everything.

- Open the shepherd's own `shepd.out.log`/`shepd.err.log` `O_APPEND` in the
  launcher. The daemon inherits both as fds 1 and 2 and never opens them
  itself, so `File::create`'s plain `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC` left both
  descriptors tracking their own offset for the daemon's whole life — and a
  descriptor tracking its own offset writes PAST an external truncation rather
  than at offset 0 of the emptied file. Measured: ten bytes, an external
  truncate, three more bytes, and the file is thirteen bytes of which the
  first ten are `NUL`; under `O_APPEND` the same sequence leaves three. This
  is the sparse hole `shep-daemon`'s `open_append` argues about for a sheep's
  logs, in the one place shep opens a log file that is not a sheep's, and
  `shep flush --daemon` is the truncation that would have walked into it. The
  launch-time emptying is kept — `std` refuses `append` together with
  `truncate`, so it is a `set_len(0)` on the appending handle — and reusing one
  `$SHEP_HOME` across relaunches still starts both files empty. A daemon
  launched by an older `shep`, or run in the foreground behind the operator's
  own shell redirection, keeps whatever descriptor it was given.
- Stop holding `std::io::stderr().lock()` for the daemon's entire lifetime.
  `run` took the process-wide stdout and stderr guards before dispatching,
  which is right for verbs that last milliseconds and wrong for the one that
  runs until a signal: `Stderr`'s lock is re-entrant only for the thread
  holding it, so the first record any tokio worker wrote blocked forever and
  took the supervisor down with it — silently, leaving an empty
  `shepd.err.log` and a daemon that still accepted connections but answered
  no handshake. The `daemon` arm now holds no handle at all — its two error
  envelopes take the lock for the length of one write each, which is also what
  stops a record from a live worker tearing a `--format json` envelope in half
  — and `bleats`, which follows until Ctrl-C and had the identical shape, now
  uses unlocked handles that take the lock per write. The guard had been held
  harmlessly since this crate's first day, because nothing wrote to stderr off
  the main thread until the daemon grew a subscriber for its own records.
- Give the workspace's path dependencies a version alongside their `path`,
  which `cargo publish` requires.
- Read `[daemon] enabled_dogs` and `[daemon] adopted_dogs` at daemon boot:
  each enabled name becomes a dog `shep_daemon::boot` starts once the flock
  is back, and a name present in `adopted_dogs` is that dog's own binary
  rather than a built-in one. Both knobs previously parsed, validated and
  round-tripped but went nowhere — a boot-time `warn!` said as much, since
  there was no dogs infrastructure yet to read either one. That warning is
  gone now that there is: a daemon starting two dogs while warning that it
  has no dogs infrastructure would be worse than saying nothing at all.

### Changes

- **The CLI binary crate is renamed from `shep-cli` to `shep`.** The
  package name now matches the `[[bin]]` it has always produced, so
  `cargo install shep` installs it — the mismatch where the package was
  `shep-cli` but the binary was `shep`, forcing `cargo install shep-cli`,
  is gone. Nothing was ever published under either name before this
  release, so there is no migration for an existing install: this is the
  name the crate ships under from its first `cargo publish`. `shep-cli`
  itself is not freed up for someone else to squat — it is published
  separately, once, as an empty placeholder with no `[[bin]]` (so
  `cargo install shep-cli` fails outright) whose README and doc comment
  point at `shep`. See that crate's own listing for the full reasoning.

- **A Linux host with no `/run/systemd/system` is now refused instead of
  being written a systemd unit.** `shep startup` used to write and enable a
  `Type=notify` unit unconditionally on any Linux target, including a
  container with no init to ever read it. It now probes at runtime —
  `/run/systemd/system` a directory means systemd, `/run/openrc/softlevel` or
  `/run/openrc` a directory means openrc, neither means refuse, naming both
  paths — because systemd and openrc share one compile target and cannot be
  told apart any other way. This is the phase's one user-visible regression:
  a container that got a (useless) unit before now gets a refusal. `--init
  systemd` restores the old behaviour where that is actually wanted.
