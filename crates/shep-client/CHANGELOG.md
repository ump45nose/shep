### Fixed

- Say what to do about a protocol mismatch


### Changed

- `ConnectError::ProtocolMismatch`'s `Display` says what to do about the
  skew instead of stating it twice and stopping. A refused dog is refused
  before it can issue a single request, so that one line is the entire
  account of the failure that reaches its log; it now names both remedies
  (rebuild this program against the daemon's version, or upgrade shep and
  reload) because the type cannot tell which of the two builds is the older
  one, and a line that guessed would send half its readers to reinstall the
  wrong thing. `daemon_version` is rendered now — it was deliberately left
  out while this was a bare statement of the skew, and a protocol number is
  not something anyone can install.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-08-29


## [0.1.10] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- `testing::fake_client_answering`, a fake daemon whose reply to each request
  comes from a caller-supplied closure while every envelope is still forwarded
  to the caller. The existing fakes each did one half: one shows the wire but
  answers everything `Pong`, so a caller that reads its own reply and decides
  what to send next stalls at the first request; the other answers a
  `ListFlock` properly but keeps its envelopes to itself. A verb that lists,
  decides from the listing, and then sends needs both at once. Available under
  the `test-support` feature, like the rest of the module.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-28


## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-28


## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-26

### Additions

This crate's whole public surface shipped without a CHANGELOG entry at the
time; this is that entry, written retrospectively once the surface was
proven end-to-end (shep-cli's `tests/cli_e2e.rs`) rather than piecemeal per
change.
Everything below is a stability surface as of this release — a breaking
change to any of it is a `[Unreleased]` entry of its own, not a silent diff.

- Add `Client`: `connect`/`connect_with_timeout` (a full handshake, never a
  bare `connect(2)` — a bound-but-not-accepting socket still completes that,
  so only a completed handshake counts as "a daemon answered"),
  `request`/`request_with_deadline` (typed `Request` → `Response`,
  `RequestError` on failure), `subscribe` (topic globs → `EventStream`),
  `daemon` (the `HelloAck` the handshake already produced — reading it again
  is a wasted round trip), `socket` (the path this client is connected to),
  and `close`.
- Add `ConnectError`, `RequestError` and (in the `spawn` module) `SpawnError`
  — one error enum per module per IR-18, each `#[non_exhaustive]` (IR-20):
  every one of them is a library-crate public error type downstream code
  matches on, and each is expected to grow as this crate's own coverage
  does.
- Add `EventStream` (a named `Stream` type, IR-15) and `Lagged` — a
  subscription's own item type, distinguishing "this client's receiver fell
  behind reading its socket" from `BusEvent::Dropped` (the daemon's own
  outbound queue overflowing), which is a different fault on the other side
  of the connection. `EventStream::next` is an inherent method, so pulling
  one event needs no `futures-util` dependency of the caller's own; the
  `Stream` trait itself is also re-exported from the crate root
  (`#[doc(inline)]`, IR-32) for callers that need it nameable in a bound.
- Add the `spawn` module: `connect_or_spawn`/`connect_or_spawn_with` (the
  autostart state machine — probe, launch only on "nothing listening", retry
  with backoff against a total deadline), `SpawnOutcome`, `SpawnOptions`, and
  `SpawnError`. Kept as a qualified module rather than flattened into the
  crate root on purpose: `spawn::DAEMON_ALREADY_RUNNING` reads as a
  deliberate cross-crate agreement at every call site, not an ordinary
  import.
- `DAEMON_ALREADY_RUNNING = 10` is a cross-crate contract with `shep-cli`:
  the daemon subprocess a losing `connect_or_spawn` racer launches exits
  with exactly this status when another process's `flock(2)` won the
  cold-start race, which is how the racer tells its own parent "keep
  probing, this was not a real failure" across a process boundary that
  carries no other channel. `shep-cli`'s `ExitCode::DaemonAlreadyRunning`
  hard-codes the same number (`exit.rs`'s own test pins them equal); this is
  what lets two genuinely concurrent `shep start` invocations against a cold
  `$SHEP_HOME` both exit 0 (proven against two real, concurrent processes by
  `shep-cli`'s `tests/cli_e2e.rs`).
- Add the timing constants every retry/deadline in this crate reads from,
  each named rather than an inline magic number (IR-26): `DEFAULT_DEADLINE`,
  `START_DEADLINE` (longer — a cold spawn plus a readiness probe routinely
  outruns the default), `LOG_PLANE_DEADLINE` (longer for its own reason — the
  daemon walks the matched flock file by file for `Reopen` and `Flush` alike,
  one sheep at a time with no bound of its own on a wedged or NFS-backed log
  directory), `TRIGGER_DEADLINE` (60s — an app's own `action_timeout` can be
  configured up to 58s, so anything shorter would abandon a `Request::Trigger`
  reply the daemon was still honestly building; the daemon clamps any
  deadline a caller asks for to the same 60s regardless, so asking for more
  buys nothing), `DEADLINE_GRACE`, `HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`, `SPAWN_DEADLINE`,
  `BACKOFF_START`, `BACKOFF_CAP`. `LOG_PLANE_DEADLINE` was briefly named
  `REOPEN_DEADLINE`, before `Flush` gave the same 30 seconds a second reader
  and the reopen-specific name stopped being true; both verbs read the one
  constant, so the budget cannot drift between them.
- Add the `test-support` feature: `pub mod testing`, the one home for every
  hand-rolled fake this crate and `shep-cli` share (`FakeDaemon` and its
  scripting methods, `fake_client_*` constructors), the same
  `publish = false`-avoiding shape `shep-daemon`'s own `test-fakes` uses. A
  separate fakes crate was tried and reverted the same day it was proposed:
  it would have needed a dev-dependency cycle (a fakes crate depending on
  `shep-client` while `shep-client` dev-depends on it back) to keep the
  scaffolding out of the published source, which is not a shape worth
  leaving in the tree to avoid one Cargo feature.
- Re-export `shep_core` at the crate root, so downstream users need a single
  dependency rather than naming both crates themselves.
- Add `testing::fake_daemon_accepting_repeatedly` — a fake that binds and
  answers every connection with one reply each, until its handle is
  aborted, for `shep whistle`: the first caller in this workspace that opens
  a fresh connection per request rather than reusing one. Every other fake
  in this module accepts exactly one connection, which is right for a
  caller handed an already-connected `Client` but not for this one. Returns
  an `Arc<AtomicU32>` request counter alongside the `JoinHandle`, since the
  accept loop never ends on its own and a test needs to read the count
  while the fake is still running.

### Fixes

- The handshake-close test asserts the unreachable outcome rather than one
  `ConnectError` variant, so it passes on Linux, where the peer's close
  surfaces on the write rather than the read.
